# Image Classifier
The aim of this project was to develop code for a Deep Learning image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

### Installations

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Summary
This project is part of the first term of the Data Scientists Nanodegree of Udacity. The main objective was to create an app that trains a Deep Learning model on a dataset of images, then use the trained model to classify images.

### Data
The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large we cannot upload it onto Github. We will be training using 102 different types of flowers, with ~20 images per flower to train on.
