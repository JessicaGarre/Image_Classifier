# Image Classifier
The aim of this project was to develop code for a Deep Learning image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

### Installations
For the development of the project, the following Python libraries were required: 

Pandas
Numpy
PyTorch
Matplotlib
In addition, Python 3 was used. 

### Summary
This project is part of the first term of the Data Scientists Nanodegree of Udacity. The main objective was to create an app that trains a Deep Learning model on a dataset of images, then use the trained model to classify images.

### Data
The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large we cannot upload it onto Github. We will be training using 102 different types of flowers, with ~20 images per flower to train on.
